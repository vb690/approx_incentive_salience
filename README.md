## Approximating Attributed Incentive Salience in Large Scale Scenarios
### A Representation Learning Approach Based on Artificial Neural Networks

## Motivation

## Data

Due to commerical sensitivity and  [data protection regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) we are not allowed to pubblicly release the data employed in the present work. Howevere, we will try to provide an illustrative example on the data format expected by this project.

### Behavioural Features
The behavioural features employed for this project comes from the area of application of predicting the intensity of future interacions between individuals and videogames. They describe the intensity of interactions (i.e. game sessions) between an individual (i.e. an user) and an object (i.e. a videogames).

* `sess_order`: order of the interaction in the sequence of considered interactions.
* `absence`: time elapsed since the previous interaction.
* `sess_played_time`: total duration of the interaction.
* `sess_time`: ammount of time spent actively interacting with the game (it is always a fraction of `session_played_time`).
* `activity`: total number of different actions perfromed during the interaction.
* `max_sess`: maximum number of interactons recorded for a specific individual.
* `context`: context from which the interaction comes from.

### Examples Datasets
The interaction data obtained from each object, should be stored in separate `.csv` files located in the `data\csv` directory inside the project root directory. We report here some synthetic examples of the dataset we employed.

|   ZZZ   |       1       |    12   |          21         |      21      |     3    |         2        |   jc3   |
|   ZZZ   |       2       |    13   |          8          |       9      |    26    |         2        |   jc3   |

In order to generalize our approach to other fields of application, the required data should entail the concept of "interaction" meaning a fixed ammount of time during which an individual interact with an object. The intensity of this interaction must be quantifiable, the behavioural features we proposed can be a starting point but other ad-hoc measure can be employed. Each considered individual should at least have had 2 interactions with an object. Knowing the eaxact nature of the considered objects is not mandatory but each object must be distinguisheable from the others.
